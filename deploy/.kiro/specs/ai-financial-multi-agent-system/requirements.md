# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an AI Financial Multi-Agent System that automates accounting and financial operations for SMBs. The system integrates deeply with financial ecosystems including accounting software, ERP systems, POS systems, and industry-specific software. It provides two main workflows: (1) Advisory services for CEOs with forecasting and alerts, and (2) Transactional automation for accounting processes.

3. WHEN bank reconciliation is needed THEN the system SHALL automatically reconcile bank statements with ERP data
4. WHEN month-end closing occurs THEN the system SHALL expedite book closing with complete audit trails

### Requirement 7: Monitoring and Observability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring of all agent activities, so that I can ensure system reliability and track performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents operate THEN the system SHALL use Langfuse as OTLP backend to receive logs from multiple services
2. WHEN LLM interactions occur THEN the system SHALL log all prompts and track token usage statistics
3. WHEN system errors occur THEN they SHALL be traced across all services with proper correlation IDs
4. WHEN performance issues arise THEN the system SHALL provide detailed metrics and alerts
5. WHEN audit trails are needed THEN the system SHALL maintain complete logs of all financial operations
